b.State-level incentives: Many states offer their own incentives to encourage homeowners and businesses to install solar panels. These incentives can include rebates, tax credits, and performance-based incentives.

c.Utility company rebates: Some utility companies offer rebates to customers who install solar panels. These rebates can help offset the cost of your solar panel system.
