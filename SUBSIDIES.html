        <h2>In India, several subsidies and incentives are available for the installation of solar panels. Some of the key subsidies and incentives are:<br><br>

            1.Solar Rooftop Subsidy Scheme: This scheme provides a subsidy of up to 40% for the installation of solar panels on residential and institutional rooftops in several states and Union Territories in India.<br><br>
            
            2.Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) Subsidy: The MNRE provides subsidies for both off-grid and grid-connected solar power projects. The subsidy varies based on the capacity of the solar project.<br><br>
            
            3.Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) Scheme: The REC scheme provides a financial incentive to entities that generate renewable energy, including solar power. The scheme allows these entities to sell RECs to obligated entities who need to meet their renewable purchase obligations.<br><br>
            
            4.Accelerated Depreciation: Businesses can claim accelerated depreciation of up to 80% of the capital cost of a solar power plant in the first year of operation, which reduces the tax liability of the business.<br><br>
            
            5.Net Metering: Net metering allows solar power system owners to feed excess power generated by their solar panels back into the grid and receive a credit for the excess power.<br><br>
            
            6.State-Specific Subsidies: Many states in India offer their own solar subsidies and incentives, which vary based on the state's solar energy potential and policy.<br><br>
            
            It is important to note that these subsidies and incentives are subject to change, and interested individuals and businesses should consult with local authorities and experts to understand the latest policies and programs available.
