<h2>(1.) Subsidies on solar panels have been implemented in many countries around the world, with varying levels
		of success. Some countries, such as Germany, China, and the United States, have implemented generous 
		subsidies that have helped to create a thriving solar industry. Other countries, such as Australia and 
		the United Kingdom, have had more mixed results, with some subsidy programs being criticized for being 
		too complex or insufficiently funded.</h2>
<h2>(2.)Federal/State Subsidies: Many countries offer federal or state-level 
 subsidies to promote solar energy. These can come in the form of tax credits, rebates, or grants.
  For example, in the United States, the federal government offers a Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) 
  which allows homeowners and businesses to deduct a portion of the cost of installing a solar energy system from their taxes.</h2><br>


<h2>(3.)The main goal of these subsidies is to reduce the cost of solar panel installation and make it 
more affordable for households and businesses to switch to renewable energy. By doing so, governments 
aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change while promoting energy independence 
and security.</h2><br>
